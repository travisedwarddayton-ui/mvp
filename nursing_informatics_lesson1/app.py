    Nursing Informatics (NI) is not just about computers ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **improving how nurses think, document, and care** 
    using information and technology. Every nurse today, whether in a rural clinic or teaching hospital, interacts with data daily.

    Learning NI helps you:
    - **Make better decisions**: Turn raw observations into insights that guide patient care.
    - **Save time and reduce errors**: Learn how good data entry, standardized terms, and usability design make care safer.
    - **Improve communication**: Use digital tools to connect with other healthcare workers, labs, and patients faster.
    - **Stay relevant**: Modern hospitals expect nurses to work with EHRs, mobile apps, and AI-assisted devices.
    - **Advance your career**: Informatics is now a recognized nursing specialty with global demand for data-savvy nurses.
    - **Strengthen local healthcare**: Nigerian nurses using open-source and low-cost digital tools can bridge resource gaps and lead innovation.
