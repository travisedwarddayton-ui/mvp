# --- Vendor List (instead of diagram) ---
st.markdown("""
Hospitals typically manage connections to **15â€“20 different imaging IT vendors**, each
operating as a siloed "cloud" with its own PACS, VNA, viewer, or exchange.  

### ðŸŒ© Core Vendors (widely used in hospitals)
- GE Healthcare
- Philips Healthcare
- Agfa HealthCare
- Sectra
- Merative (Merge, ex-IBM)
- Fujifilm (Synapse)
- Change Healthcare / Optum
- Infinitt Healthcare
- Novarad
- Hyland Healthcare
- Intelerad
- Ambra Health
- Life Image

### ðŸŒ© Extended Vendors (secondary but growing)
- Siemens Healthineers (syngo.via, AI Rad Companion)
- Carestream Health (enterprise imaging, PACS)
- Visage Imaging (enterprise viewer)
- PaxeraHealth (vendor-neutral PACS, modular solutions)
- Mach7 Technologies (VNA + interoperability)

---
### ðŸ“Œ Key Insight
- Each of these vendors represents a **separate 'cloud' or silo**.  
- Hospitals must integrate all of them individually, which creates:
  - Fragmented data across silos  
  - Duplicate scans and inefficiencies  
  - Slower diagnosis and delayed care  
  - Compliance and interoperability risks  
  - High IT maintenance costs

### Insights
- **Top validated pains**: Imaging data fragmentation (18.75%) and Compliance obligations (16.67%).  
- **Medium validation**: Data quality frameworks (6.67%).  
- **Weak framing**: General "data silos" (5.17%).  

### Why This Is Viable
- Specific clinical pain (modalities, priors) resonates much stronger than broad "data silo" talk.  
- Compliance burden (esp. oncology) also shows strong engagement.  
- Validates business opportunity: hospitals want **workflow simplification + compliance protection**.
